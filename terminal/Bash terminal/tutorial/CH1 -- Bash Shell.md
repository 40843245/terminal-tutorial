# CH1 -- Bash Shell
## objectives
I will introduce 

  + the history of Bash Shell
  + where built-in commands in Bash Shell come from

## CH1-1 -- history of Bash Shell
The Bash Shell is based on Bourne Shell

```
Unix Shell -> Bourne Shell -> Bash Shell
```

## CH1-2 -- built-in commands in Bash Shell
Since Bash Shell is based on Bourne Shell, it leaves the built-in commands in Bourne Shell as its built-in commands for compatibility.

However, some built-in commands in Bash Shell are improved or extended from built-in commands of Bourne Shell.

See other CH to know built-in commands in Bash Shell.
